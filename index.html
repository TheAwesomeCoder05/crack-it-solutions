<h2 id="john-went-for-shopping">John went for shopping.</h2>
<p>Q: John went for shopping with ₹500 and bought the following:
<br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>Bread - ₹25</li>
  <li>Rice (2 kg) - ₹69.2 per kg</li>
  <li>Potatoes - ₹40</li>
  <li>Onion - ₹37</li>
  <li>Honey - ₹109.7</li>
  <li>Spinach - ₹8</li>
  <li>Cinnamon - ₹178
<br /> <!--The comment tag and the line break HTML tags can even be used in MARKDOWN-->
There was a discount of 10%. Further, he already had an extra payment of ₹78 with the shopkeeper. So, finally how much amount is he left with?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="answer">Answer:</h2>
<h3 id="step-1">Step 1:</h3>
<p>Firstly, find the total amount of money he paid initially by adding all the values.
<br /></p>

<p><em>25 + 69.2 (2) + 40 + 37 + 109.7 + 8 + 178 = 536.1</em></p>

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2:</h3>
<p>Now, find 10% of the sum and subtract that value from it as discount. Round it to nearest hundredths.
<br /></p>

<p><em>536.1 - {(10/100) * 536.1} = 536.1 - 53.61 = 482.49</em></p>

<h3 id="step-3">Step 3:</h3>
<p>Money he is left with now =
<br /></p>

<p><em>500 - 482.49 = 17.51</em></p>

<h3 id="step-4">Step 4:</h3>
<p>Since the shopkeeper gave the extra payment back so, subtract -78 from 17.51.
<br /></p>

<p><em>17.51 - (-78) = 17.51 + 78 = 95.51</em></p>

<p><strong>Hence, John was finally left with $95.51.</strong></p>

<h2 id="sophia-the-microbiologist">Sophia the microbiologist.</h2>
<p>Q: Sophia is a microbiologist. She noticed that Bacteria A needs an optimum temperature of -25ºC to survive. Bacteria B needs -61ºC to survive. Whereas, Bacteria C needs 3/4th the temperature of the difference between the temperatures of Bacteria B and A. So, what is the optimal temperature that Bacteria C needs to survive?</p>

<h2 id="answer-1">Answer:</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-1">Step 1:</h3>
<p>Firstly find the difference between the temperatures required by Bacteria A and B to survive.
<br /></p>

<p><em>-25 - (-61) = 36</em></p>

<h3 id="step-2-1">Step 2:</h3>
<p>Finally, calculate 3/4th of the difference.
<br /></p>

<p><em>3/4 (36) = 27</em></p>

<p><strong>Therefore, Bacteria C would need an optimal temperature of 27ºC to survive.</strong></p>

<h2 id="excavation-site">Excavation site</h2>
<p>Q: At an excavation site, 2 meters can be dug in a minute. Three drillers with the same speed
dig on the same spot. After 10 mins, one of the drillers stopped working. If there was a fossil 180 meters below the land, how much time would it take to be found?</p>

<h2 id="answer-2">Answer:</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-2">Step 1:</h3>
<p>First, let’s find out how many meters of the ground was dug in 10 mins by three drillers.
<br /></p>

<p><em>3{-2 (10)} = 3 {-20} = -60</em></p>

<h3 id="step-2-2">Step 2:</h3>
<p>The remaining meters to be dug =
<br /></p>

<p><em>-180 - (-60) = -120</em>
<br /></p>

<p>So we have to dig 120 meters more below the ground.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-1">Step 3:</h3>
<p>Since there are 2 drillers, both of them can dig <em>2 × (-2) = <strong>-4</strong></em> <strong>meters</strong> below the ground. So, the time required to dig 120 meters below the ground is:
<br /></p>

<p><em>-120/-4 = 30</em></p>

<h3 id="step-4-1">Step 4:</h3>
<p>The total time taken by the 3 drillers and the time taken after one of them stopped working =
<br /></p>

<p><em>10 + 30 = 40</em></p>

<p><strong>Thus, it would take 40 minutes for the fossil to be reached and found.</strong></p>

<h2 id="true-or-false">True or False</h2>
<p>Q: When you subtract a negative number from any number the answer should always be negative.
<br /></p>

<h2 id="answer-3">Answer:</h2>
<p><strong>Not always. This is only true if the absolute value of the negative number being subtracted is greater than the absolute value of the other number.</strong></p>

<h2 id="fill-in-the-blank">Fill in the blank</h2>
<p>Q: -159 - ___ = 99</p>

<h2 id="answer-4">Answer:</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-3">Step 1:</h3>
<p>Let’s solve this problem like an <strong><em>Algebraic Equation</em></strong>. We can denote the number we need to find as a variable ‘x’.
<!--Set var = x-->
<br /></p>

<p><em>-159 - x = 99</em></p>

<h3 id="step-2-3">Step 2:</h3>
<p>We can now isolate the variable just like we would do in an Algebraic Equation. That can be done by adding 159 to both the sides.
<br /></p>

<p><em><del>-159 + 159</del> - x = 99 + 159</em></p>

<h3 id="step-3-2">Step 3:</h3>
<p>Simplify this further.
<br /></p>

<p><em>-x = 99 + 159 = 258</em></p>

<h3 id="step-4-2">Step 4:</h3>
<p>Finally, to get the value of x, we can multiply both the sides by -1.
<br /></p>

<p><em>-x (-1) = 258 (-1)</em>
<em>x = -258</em></p>

<p><strong>Therefore, the correct answer is -258.</strong></p>
